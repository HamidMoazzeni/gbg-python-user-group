## Learning python
* [Codecademy: Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) - Gentle and interactive introduction to Python basics, step-by-step construction of complex programs from simpler building blocks.
* [Learn Python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)

More advanced coding can be learned by using it in your own bioinformatics project or solving coding problems. There are many websites that offer coding problems, such as [Simple Programming Problems](http://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html), [46 Simple Python Exercises](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html), [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.or/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks), and many more.
